# CSCE 441 Computer Graphics

CSCE 441 Computer Graphics at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) with Dr. Nima Kalantari

## Getting Started
There is a tutorial repository that goes over the basics of the course: https://github.com/pulchroxloom/csce441-opengl-tutorial

**Mac Only:** Here is an install script that sets up the required libraries for the course. *Requires Homebrew to be installed and `zsh` to be the default shell. `zsh` is the default shell on modern Macs and it is recommended to upgrade if the shell is `bash`. You can check with `echo $SHELL` in terminal.*

Run this command where you want to install the `GLFW` libraries to. This can be your Documents folder, as is used in the tutorial.
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pulchroxloom/csce441/main/install_graphics.sh)"
```

It also has a live website: https://pulchroxloom.github.io/csce441-opengl-tutorial/
